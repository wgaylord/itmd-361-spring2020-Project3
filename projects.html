	    <em>Satellite Network of Ground Stations</em>
	    <p>This project uses raspberry pis and RTLSDRs to create a global network of ground stations for lsitening to satelites in oribt.</p>
	    <p>I run a ground station for this project and also contribute to this project in to ways</p>

	    <a class="boldplain" href=https://https://satnogs.jwgtechs.com/>Realtime Satnogs Network Activity Map</a>
        <p>This project uses the api from the Network site of the SatNOGS project to create a map showing what sattellites are being actively listened to and what stations are listening to them.</p>
	    <p>The code for the majority of this was writen in December of 2018 with major changes happening around Feburary of 2019.</p>
	    <p>The current source code is available from a <a href=https://gitlab.com/chibill/satnogsmap>Gitlab Repository</a></p>
	    <p>I am currently working on a new version of the website using Django instead of Flask as the backend. It has its own <a href=https://gitlab.com/chibill/satnogsglobalnetworkmonitor>Gitlab Repositoy.</a></p>

	    <strong>Satnogs Network Activity Replay Map</strong>
	    <p>This project uses the api from the Network site of the SatNOGS project to create a map showing a replay of an event for a single satellite on the network.</p>
	    <p>This started as a neat way to reply Internation Space Station Slow Scan TV events. (ISS SSTV) But has evolved to allow replaying any satellite on the network.</p>
	    <p>This project is not currently being developed or mantainted due to how sloppy the code currently is. Its current code is available from a <a href=https://gitlab.com/chibill/satnogsmapreplay>Gitlab Repositorty</a></p>
	    <p>I will eventually be merging this into the new Realtime Satnogs Network Activity Map. This is expected to happen far in the future.</p>
        <p>Below is video captured using a tool included in the Replay website. It uses CCapture to capture a WebM file which I then convert to mp4 for posting on Youtube.</p>

	    <strong>JarFingerPrinter</strong>
        <p>This project takes a Java Jar file and creates a JSON file that represents a fingerprint of every file within the jar..</p>
	    <p>It uses a library called Jawa to open the class files and make a fingerprint of there internals. Includign methods and variables.</p>
	    <p>This project's current code is available from a <a href=https://github.com/wgaylord/JarFingerPrinter>Github Repositorty</a></p>
